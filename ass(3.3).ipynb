        "The code generated from the first improved prompt (\"Generate a Python function `calculate_power_bill_detailed` that takes two arguments: `kwh_consumed` and `rate_per_kwh`... The function should calculate the total power bill by multiplying... Include a docstring...\") is a significant improvement over the code generated from the initial vague prompt (\"Generate python code to calculate power bill\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the key improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Explicit Input Requirements Lead to Specific Arguments:** The initial vague prompt offered no direction on what inputs were needed. This could lead to AI generating code that prompts the user for input, hardcodes values, or makes assumptions. The improved prompt, by explicitly stating that the function should take `kwh_consumed` and `rate_per_kwh` as arguments, resulted in a function with a clear, defined signature (`calculate_power_bill_detailed(kwh_consumed, rate_per_kwh)`). This makes the function immediately usable and understandable in terms of what data it expects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Defined Calculation Results in Functional Logic:** The vague prompt simply asked to \"calculate power bill\". This is a broad concept. The improved prompt, however, specifically defined the calculation as \"multiplying the `kwh_consumed` by the `rate_per_kwh`\". This clear instruction allowed the AI to generate the core logic of the function (`total_bill = kwh_consumed * rate_per_kwh`).

The function should calculate the total power bill by multiplying... Include a docstring...\") is a significant improvement over the code generated from the initial vague prompt (\"Generate python code to calculate power bill\").\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key improvements:\n\n1.  **Explicit Input Requirements Lead to Specific Arguments:** The initial vague prompt offered no direction on what inputs were needed. This could lead to AI generating code that prompts the user for input, hardcodes values, or makes assumptions. The improved prompt, by explicitly stating that the function should take `kwh_consumed` and `rate_per_kwh` as arguments, resulted in a function with a clear, defined signature (`calculate_power_bill_detailed(kwh_consumed, rate_per_kwh)`). This makes the function immediately usable and understandable in terms of what data it expects.\n\n2.  **Defined Calculation Results in Functional Logic:** The vague prompt simply asked to \"calculate power bill\". This is a broad concept. The improved prompt, however, specifically defined the calculation as \"multiplying the `kwh_consumed` by the `rate_per_kwh`\". This clear instruction allowed the AI to generate the core logic of the function (`total_bill = kwh_consumed * rate_per_kwh`). The initial vague prompt's code also performed this multiplication, but it was an assumption based on the simplest interpretation, not a direct instruction. The improved prompt ensures this specific, albeit basic, functionality.\n\n3.  **Inclusion of a Docstring:** The improved prompt explicitly requested the inclusion of a docstring. This directive was followed by the AI, resulting in a docstring that explains the function's purpose, its arguments, and what it returns. The initial code also happened to include a docstring, but this is not guaranteed with a vague prompt; the explicit request makes documentation a requirement, leading to more maintainable and understandable code.\n\n4.  **Clearer Purpose and Usability:** While both versions calculate a basic bill, the code from the improved prompt has a clearer purpose defined by its explicit inputs and calculation. The function signature and docstring immediately tell a user how to use it and what it does, which was not guaranteed with the initial vague prompt.\n\nIn summary, the first improved prompt transformed a vague request into a set of specific instructions regarding inputs, calculation, and documentation. This directly resulted in generated code that is more structured, more predictable, includes essential documentation, and is therefore a clear improvement in terms of clarity and meeting a defined requirement, even if the billing model itself is still very simplified.\n"

Then, it should calculate the total power bill by adding the usage-based cost and the `fixed_monthly_charge`.\n\nThe function should return a dictionary containing the breakdown of charges and the total bill. The dictionary should include the following keys:\n*   `usage_cost`: The calculated cost based on energy consumption.\n*   `fixed_charge`: The value of the fixed monthly charge.\n*   `total_bill`: The sum of the usage cost and the fixed charge.\n\nInclude a docstring explaining the function, its arguments, and what it returns.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Third Improved Prompt\n\nThis third improved prompt (`Improved Prompt (Step 3)`) is better than the previous prompts because it specifies the desired output format. While the previous prompts focused on defining the inputs and the calculation logic, this prompt adds a requirement for how the results should be presented.\n\n1.  **Specifying Output Format:** The key improvement here is the explicit instruction to return a dictionary with specific keys (`usage_cost`, `fixed_charge`, `total_bill`). The previous prompts only asked for the total bill amount. Returning a structured output like a dictionary makes the function's result much more useful.\n2.  **Providing a Breakdown of Charges:** By requesting a dictionary that includes `usage_cost` and `fixed_charge` separately, the prompt ensures that the function provides a detailed breakdown of how the total bill is composed. This is incredibly valuable for understanding the bill, unlike just getting a single total number.\n3.  **Enhanced Usability:** A structured output format (like a dictionary) is easy for other parts of a program to process. You can easily access individual components of the bill (e.g., `result['usage_cost']`) for further calculations, reporting, or display. Returning just a single number limits how the result can be used.\n4.  **Clearer Contract:** Defining the exact structure of the output provides a clearer contract for the function. Anyone using this function knows exactly what keys to expect in the returned dictionary and what information each key holds.\n\nBy specifying the output format and requesting a breakdown of charges in a dictionary, this prompt guides the AI to generate code that is not only functionally correct in calculating the bill but also provides the results in a highly usable and informative format, making the function significantly more valuable than those generated by the previous prompts.\n"

It simply performs the calculation, assuming the input is in Celsius. This can lead to silent errors where an incorrect conversion is performed without any indication to the user.\n5.  **Limited Real-World Applicability:** In real-world applications, temperature data can come in various units. A function limited to only one specific conversion is not practical for most scenarios requiring temperature handling.\n\nIn essence, the vague prompt resulted in a function that is a \"one-trick pony.\" It performs a single, assumed conversion and cannot be easily adapted or extended to handle the broader task of general temperature conversion between different scales. This highlights how lack of specificity in prompts forces AI to make assumptions, often leading to code that is narrow in scope and lacks the flexibility required for many real-world problems.\n"
