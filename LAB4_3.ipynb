        "    *   If the file exists, it opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) using a `with` statement, which ensures the file is automatically closed.\n",
        "    *   `sum(1 for line in f)` is a concise way to iterate through each line in the file object `f` and count them.\n",
        "    *   The function returns the `line_count`.\n",
        "    *   A `try...except` block is included to catch any potential errors during file reading.\n",
        "*   **Explanation:** The explanation describes the purpose of the function, how it handles file existence and reading, and how it counts the lines. It also mentions that you would need to create the example files to test the function and includes commented-out example usage."
